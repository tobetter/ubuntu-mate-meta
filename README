Run the "update" script to automatically generate new dependency
lists.  The result will be based on the published seed lists, filtered
by:

- The Packages files (nonexistent packages will be skipped)

- debootstrap (packages not yet added to debootstrap will not be added
  to ubuntu-base)

## Rebuilding the meta package

Install the required tools.

    apt-get install devscripts debhelper dput python-scour quilt

Export your name and email address registered with Laucnhpad.

    export DEBEMAIL="code@flexion.org"
    export DEBFULLNAME="Martin Wimpress"

Update the dependency lists, from the seeds (only required if you've
pushed changes the seeds repository) and this will also update the
changelog.

    ./update

If you need, or want, to update the changelog then something like the following will do it.

    dch --distribution utopic --newversion 1.000ppa1 --force-bad-version --urgency=medium "Describe what changed."

Set the release target.

    sed -i 's/UNRELEASED/utopic/' debian/changelog

Build the package, use a signing key register with Lauchpad.

    dpkg-buildpackage -d -S -sa -k0864983E

Upload the package to Lanchpad for building.

    dput ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/ppa `ls -1tr ../ubuntu-mate-meta*_source.changes | tail -n1`
